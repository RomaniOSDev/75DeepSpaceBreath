# App Store listing — make the app clearly unique (avoid 4.3 Spam)

Use this in App Store Connect to stress that Deep Space Breath is a **distinct** app, not a generic breathing template.

## Description (copy-paste and adjust)

**Deep Space Breath** is a breathing and recovery app built around a single idea: every technique is a star system, and every session adds a star to your personal galaxy.

**What makes it different**

• **Five “star systems”** — not generic timers. Each program has its own space metaphor: Neutron Star (4-7-8 intense recovery), Orbital Balance (square breathing), Expanding Nebula (progressive relaxation), Gravitational Waves (stress relief), Solar Charge (energy).

• **Galaxy Progress** — your sessions become a map of stars. Star color = program type, brightness = session length, size = how much you lowered your pulse. Tap any star to see session details.

• **Cosmic Cardiogram** — your pulse over time on a dark space-style chart, plus trends like “On Tuesdays you relax best.”

• **Space-themed achievements** — Stable Orbit (7-day streak), Supernova (25% pulse drop in one session), Black Hole of Calm (30 min session), Solar Wind (5 morning sessions in a week).

• **After Workout** flow — pick HIIT, Cardio, or Strength and get a recommended program. Manual pulse in and out (no HealthKit). Reminders, favorites, and tempo control (0.8×–1.2×).

**Breathe. Recover. Transcend.**

Designed for post-workout recovery and daily breathing practice, with a consistent space look and no subscriptions required for core features.

## What to avoid (reduces spam risk)
- Do not use the same description or screenshots as other apps.
- Do not present the app as a generic “breathing timer” or “meditation app” — stress the space/galaxy concept and the five named programs.
- Screenshots should show your real UI (dark theme, galaxy, star map, cosmic cardiogram).

## If you resubmit
1. In **App Review Notes**, add one short line:  
   “This app is an original concept: breathing programs as star systems, with Galaxy Progress map and Cosmic Cardiogram. It is not a template or reskin.”
2. Ensure the binary is the same app as in the description (unique icon, name, and in-app wording).
3. If you have other apps under the same or different account that look similar, consider removing or significantly differentiating them.
